-Generated new project for analyzing simple substitution ciphers

01 October 2023
-Got "Cracking Codes with Python" book to help suss out how to handle cracking substitution cipher decoding
    -Created new branch "ReverseCipher" off of main branch.
        -Created "Exercises" directory for storing exercises from Cracking Codes with Python
            -Created new file "reverseCipher.py"
                -Few lines of code that take input & provide a "mirrored"("derorrim") version of the string.
        -Added reverseCipher function to main.py
        -Added sarcasticCipher function to main.py
            -Takes inputted string & provides a "sarcastic"("sArCaStIc") output of it.
    -Merged ReverseCipher branch into main branch.
