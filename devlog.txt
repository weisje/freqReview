-Generated new project for analyzing simple substitution ciphers

01 October 2023
-Got "Cracking Codes with Python" book to help suss out how to handle cracking substitution cipher decoding
    -Created new branch "ReverseCipher" off of main branch.
        -Created "Exercises" directory for storing exercises from Cracking Codes with Python
            -Created new file "reverseCipher.py"
                -Few lines of code that take input & provide a "mirrored"("derorrim") version of the string.
        -Added reverseCipher function to main.py
        -Added sarcasticCipher function to main.py
            -Takes inputted string & provides a "sarcastic"("sArCaStIc") output of it.
    -Merged ReverseCipher branch into main branch.

02 October 2023
-Generated CaesarCipher branch from main branch
    -Created Exercises > caesarCipher.py
        -Exercise for creating a basic caesar cipher where letters are shifted a defined number for encryption/decryption
    -Added caesarCipher() function to main.py
-Merged caesarCipher branch into main branch

03 October 2023
-Created CaesarHacker branch off of main branch
    -Generated Exercises > caesarHacker.py file
        -Exercise to bruteforce caesar ciphers by iterating through every possible key value
    -Added caesarHacker() to main.py as a function
-merged CaesarHacker branch into main branch
